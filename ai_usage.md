- Tool/model & version: Gemini
- What I asked for: Correct code to print the sum of odd numbers
- Snippet of prompt(s): "How can I write the code so it prints the sum of the odd numbers, not the odd numbers within the range"
- What I changed before committing: added
- odd_sum = 0
for number in range(4748, end_range + 1):
  if number % 2 != 0:
    odd_sum += number
print(odd_sum)
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): Rosalind checked
